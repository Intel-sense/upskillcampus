Smart Agriculture IoT Project(Smart Farm - an Android App)

Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Smart Agriculture IoT project aimed at assisting farmers in optimizing crop monitoring and increasing yield and product quality. The project utilizes IoT devices to gather real-time data on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil temperature.

Problem Statement

Agriculture plays a vital role in the development of our country, but persistent challenges such as inefficient monitoring and resource management hinder its progress. The aim of this project is to address these challenges by leveraging technology to provide farmers with actionable insights and improve agricultural practices.

Key Objectives:

Gather real-time data on environmental factors.
Enhance crop monitoring capabilities.
Optimize resource usage to increase yield and product quality.

Proposed Solution

The proposed solution focuses on utilizing smart agriculture IoT devices integrated with MQTT and LoRaWAN technologies. These devices collect data from sensors deployed in the field and send it to a cloud-based server for analysis. Farmers can access this data through a mobile application, enabling them to make informed decisions to optimize crop management.

Key Features:

Real-time data visualization on a mobile dashboard.
Automatic control of irrigation systems based on soil moisture levels.
Integration with cloud-based services for data storage and analysis.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
Android Studio or equivalent IDE for Android development.
Electronic component like esp32.
Knowledge of MQTT and LoRaWAN protocols.
Access to a cloud platform for hosting backend services.

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Intel-sense/upskillcampus
Set up the backend server using Node.js or Python scripts.
Open the Android project in Android Studio and configure the necessary dependencies.

Usage

Launch the mobile application on an Android device.
Connect to the firebase cloud.
View real-time data on environmental factors and crop conditions.
Take actions such as controlling irrigation systems based on the collected data.

Performance Test
Performance testing is essential to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the system. Constraints such as memory usage, speed, and power consumption must be evaluated. Test plans and procedures should be defined to measure the system's performance under various conditions.
